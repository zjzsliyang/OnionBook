This book describes some of the most important design rules and techniques that are drawn from the rational, functionalist design aesthetic seen in modern graphic design, industrial design, interior design, and architecture - and applies them to various graphical user interface problems experienced in commercial software development.','Kevin Mullet','https://img3.doubanio.com/lpic/s4214045.jpg');

These i-products, while handy, primarily confine their interactivity to the surfaces of screens. Not exactly the kind of "world-changing" transformation we've been promised. In Interactive Architecture, authors Michael Fox and Miles Kemp introduce us to a brave new world where design pioneers are busy creating environments that not only facilitate interaction between people, but also actively participate in their own right. These spaces—able to reconfigure themselves in response to human stimuli—will literally change our worlds by addressing our ever-evolving individual, social, and environmental needs. In other words, it's time to stop asking what architecture is and start asking what it can do.\nInteractive Architecture is a processes-oriented guide to creating dynamic spaces and objects capable of performing a range of pragmatic and humanistic functions. These complex physical interactions are made possible by the creative fusion of embedded computation (intelligence) with a physical, tangible counterpart (kinetics). A uniquely twenty-first century toolbox and skill set—virtual and physical modeling, sensor technology, CNC fabrication, prototyping, and robotics—necessitates collaboration across many diverse scientific and art-based communities. Interactive Architecture includes contributions from the worlds of architecture, industrial design, computer programming, engineering, and physical computing. These remarkable projects run the gamut in size and complexity. Full-scale built examples include a house in Colorado that programs itself by observing the lifestyle of the inhabitants, and then learns to anticipate and accommodate their needs. Interactive Architecture examines this vanguard movement from all sides, including its sociological and psychological implications as well as its potentially beneficial environmental impact.','Michael Fox','https://img3.doubanio.com/lpic/s6481944.jpg');

You can imagine how much it would help if there were a single perspective that you could use to simplify these complex issues down to a small set of objective principles. In UI is Communication, Everett McKay explains how to design intuitive user interfaces by focusing on effective human communication. A user interface is ultimately a conversation between users and technology. Well-designed user interfaces use the language of UI to communicate to users efficiently and naturally. They also recognize that there is an emotional human being at the other end of the interaction, so good user interfaces strive to make an emotional connection. Applying what you learn from UI is Communication will remove much of the mystic, subjectiveness, and complexity from user interface design, and help you make better design decisions with confidence. It's the perfect introduction to user interface design. It is an approachable, practical communication-based guide to interaction and visual design that you can immediately apply to projects to make solid design decisions quickly and confidently. It includes design makeovers so you can see the concepts in practice with real examples.

Yet the art world, both critically and practically, was initially slow to accept this emergence - new technology is potentially alienating and esoteric. Edward A. Shanken gives a lucid evaluation of the subject, contextualizing it in a broader art-historical and political framework. A comprehensive survey, his essay also addresses the reaction, development and future of artistic practice in the face of new technology, and how art can 'humanize and mythologize' science. Divided into seven thematic sections, the book follows a broadly chronological approach.  The seven sections of this survey include: light, space, motion, time which lays the foundations in the early twentieth century, artists introduced motion and light into their work, defying the traditional concept of art as static, lit object - the jump-off point for interactive art incorporating digital media; Coded Form and Electronic Production which shows how the emergence of computer graphics and electronic photocopying (1950s and 1960s), and high resolution digital photography, printing and rapid prototyping (1980s and 1990s) expanded the possibilities for artistic production and reproduction, challenging notions of originality and creativity; Simulation and Simulacra which describes the interactive exchanges allowed by virtual reality, engaging audiences with simulated forms and environments, playing on the trompe-l'oeil verisimilitude of art history.  Sections also include Electronic Environments which is distinctly different from virtual reality outlines performances enacted in electronic environments that enable audience feedback to influence the unfolding of various elements or demonstrate the politicized contexts in which the media (and the mass media in particular) operate. This work also includes sections such as: Networks, Surveillance, Culture Jamming which discusses public access cable television, satellite transmissions, and especially the union of computers and telecommunications, and how these have led to exchange, transfer and collaborative creation; Bodies, Surrogates, and Emergent Systems which questions the distinction between real and artificial, as artists join their bodies (and/or those of their audiences) with electronic media, creating cyborgs and robots in order to examine human existence; and, Exhibitions, Institutions and Communities which looks at how technical requirements and financial overheads demand close collaboration between artists, scientists and engineers, shaping production, reception and historicization.','Edward A.
